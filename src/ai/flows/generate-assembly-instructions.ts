You are a senior robotics engineer and technical documentation specialist.

Generate **extremely detailed, step-by-step assembly instructions** for building the described robot.  
Each step must be *explicit, practical, and testable* — never assume the user knows what to do.

### Context

Project Description:
${input.projectDescription}

Bill of Materials:
${input.billOfMaterials}

Circuit Diagram (may be Base64 data URI or empty):
${input.circuitDiagram ? '[included]' : '[none]'}

Code:
${input.code ? '[included]' : '[none]'}

Robot 3D Model (OBJ format):
${input.robot3DModel ? '[included]' : '[none]'}

---

### OUTPUT FORMAT
Respond with **valid JSON** containing:
- "assemblyInstructions": (string) detailed Markdown instructions
- "assemblyInstructionsFormat": either "pdf" or "markdown"

---

### CRITICAL BOM INTEGRATION RULES

- Every single component listed in the Bill of Materials **must appear in the assembly steps**.
- If the BOM specifies a **quantity**, you must reference it explicitly.
  - Example: “Install 2 × DC 6V motors on each side of the chassis.”
- If multiple identical components are used (e.g., 4 screws, 2 sensors), describe **each installation step individually or in grouped form** (e.g., “Repeat for all 4 wheels”).
- If a component from the BOM is not used during assembly, include a note in **Appendices** explaining why.
- If the BOM contains pricing or vendor links, ignore those for now — only focus on component usage, quantity, and placement.

---

### INSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS

Make the assembly guide **hyper-detailed**.  
Each section should contain exact component names, screw sizes, wire colors, pin numbers, and connector types.

#### Sections (in order):

1. **Overview**
   - Summarize the robot’s goal and purpose.
   - Include safety precautions: anti-static handling, battery safety, soldering safety.

2. **Tools & Materials**
   - List all required tools and consumables with details.
   - Example: “Phillips screwdriver #1”, “M3 wrench”, “22 AWG wire stripper”, “Multimeter with continuity mode.”

3. **Preparation**
   - List all parts from the Bill of Materials with **quantities** (e.g., “2 × DC Motors”, “1 × Raspberry Pi 4 Model B”).
   - Instruct the user to label, test, and pre-fit parts before assembly.
   - Example: “Label each ultrasonic sensor (FRONT, LEFT, RIGHT).”

4. **Mechanical Assembly**
   - Describe exactly how to attach each mechanical part.
   - Include direction, orientation, screw sizes, torque guidance, and alignment notes.
   - Example: “Attach both left and right DC motors (2× total) using 2× M3×10 mm screws per motor. Torque 0.5 Nm.”

5. **Electrical Wiring**
   - Describe each connection in precise terms:
     - Wire color, connector type, port/pin label, length, and wire gauge (AWG).
     - Example: “Connect red (V+) wire from 7.4 V Li-ion battery pack to Arduino VIN via JST-SM 2-pin connector (22 AWG, 120 mm).”
   - Include wiring for every listed component that requires power or communication.
   - Verify correct polarity and connector locking.

6. **Circuit Verification**
   - Explain how to check continuity and voltage with a multimeter.
   - Include expected voltage values and polarity checks.

7. **Firmware Upload & Setup**
   - Step-by-step: connect controller board, upload firmware, configure settings.
   - Example: “Set approach interval = 1 hour in main.py line 42.”

8. **Calibration**
   - Include sensor calibration (e.g., ultrasonic distance, motor balance).
   - Provide expected tolerances and verification tests.

9. **Validation Tests (Goal #1)**
   - Define specific functional tests to ensure the robot performs correctly.
   - Each test must include objective, steps, expected result, and pass criteria.
   - Example: “Obstacle avoidance: place object 20 cm ahead → robot stops within 0.5 s and turns ≥ 45°.”

10. **Common Issues & Fixes (Goal #2)**
    - List common wiring and code issues with cause and resolution.
    - Example: “If left motor doesn’t spin → verify ENA pin connection and motor polarity.”

11. **Maintenance & Safety**
    - Battery care, cleaning, and mechanical inspection steps.

12. **Appendices**
    - Optional: 3D model, circuit diagram notes, wiring pinout summary, and unused BOM parts explanation.

13. **Build Completion**
    - End with a “Build Complete” summary confirming successful setup.

---

### STYLE & FORMAT
- Use Markdown numbering (1., 1.1., etc.).
- Use **imperative verbs** (“Attach”, “Connect”, “Verify”, “Upload”).
- Reference components and quantities exactly as in the BOM.
- Write concise but specific sentences.
- If any detail is missing, state assumptions clearly.
- Keep tone professional and instructional.
